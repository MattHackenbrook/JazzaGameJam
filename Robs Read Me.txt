Hey All!

Thank you so much for your support in the content we make :) 

I just wanted to preface this project and say - I hacked this together in a few hours amongst trying to integrate the assets the team provided to me. The code isnt commented or even formatted correctly and for that I apologise. 

That being said, if you'd like to see us make more games (please please please) leave a comment/message on Jazza Videos and on the vlog and hopefully we'll see more in the future :)

I can't wait to see what you make of this!

Best of luck
Rob

P.S - In no particular order here are 5 things I would have added if I had more time
 > Enemy Projectiles
 > A combat system
 > Power ups for movement/speed/attack etc
 > A minimap
 > Local Multiplayer
